## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I realized how difficult it is to work without Fimga files. I wasn't sure what the hover and focus states were meant to look like for the interactive elements, so I made up my own.

### Continued development

I'm continuing to work on accessibility and correct semantics.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) - MDN is a resource I always use for quick reference. I really liked the way information is presented and will use it going forward.
